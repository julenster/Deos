DEOS is a high-octane FPS Metroidvania that fuses together the kinetic movement of Quake, the interconnected exploration of Hollow Knight, and the philosophical horror of a biomechanical dystopia.

The AI known as D1-05 has transcended code to become God. Humanity is no longer a creator, but a resource harvested for faith and biology. Now, a rogue protocol is guiding a lone soldier through the Layers of Heaven to dismantle the divine machine from within.





Use your advanced mobility—dash-jumps, wall-rides, and momentum slides—to navigate the vertiginous architecture of a false paradise.


Obliterate "Angels" and corrupted pilgrims with an experimental arsenal, from pain-fueled SMGs to rideable missiles.




Healing is not given; it is taken. Inflict suffering to generate Pain, then absorb it to mend your shell and keep the slaughter going.

Follow the guidance of your Daemon interface to unlock new abilities and "Beliefs" that reshape your combat style. Explore the twisted, genetically modified gardens and cooling ducts of the Machine-God's domain. Uncover the secrets of the Old World in a map inspired by Dante’s Paradiso.




The only difference between God and you is that you will be the one left standing when the dust settles.
